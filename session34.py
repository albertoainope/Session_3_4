#VCS --> Enable Version control and select Git. The python file should now be red.
#Git --> Commit. The python file should now be green.
#Git -> GitHub --> Share project on GitHub. Finally, the file is in blue.

#Computer architecture --> CPU (brute-force method, which is endless)
#CPU is like the brains (executor), and closely linked to the memory (storage for the CPU).
#Speed measured in hertz (inverse of a second) --> actions per second.
#Frequency is 5 hertz, so 1 action is done in 0.2 seconds.
#Chess cannot be solved by a CPU despite its insane speed.
#I/O Devices for input (keyboard, mouse, mic) and output (monitor, sound card)
#Algortihm is a recipe from a cookbook. Unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems.
#ARM --> A compiler translates into the machine code for the specific architecture.
#Sieve of Eratosthenes --> To find all the prime numbers less than or equal to a given integer n by Erastosthenes' method.
